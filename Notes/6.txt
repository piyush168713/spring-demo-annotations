Special Note about @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy Method Signatures

I want to provide additional details regarding the method signatures of @PostContruct and @PreDestroy methods.

Access modifier

The method can have any access modifier (public, protected, private)

Return type
The method can have any return type. However, "void' is most commonly used. If you give a
return type just note that you will not be able to capture the return value. As a result, "void" is commonly used.

Method name
The method can have any method name.

Arguments
The method can not accept any arguments. The method should be no-arg.
