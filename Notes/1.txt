AUTOWIRING

FAQ: What if there are multiple FortuneService implementations?

When using autowiring, what if there are multiple FortuneService implementations? Like in the image below?

ANSWER

Spring has special support to handle this case. Use the @Qualifier annotation.
We'll cover this later in the course with slides and code examples. But don't worry,
we will address all scenarios :-)
